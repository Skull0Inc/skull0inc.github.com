    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is my <em>(Skull0Inc)</em> introductory post for testing the use of the [<a href="http://octopress.org/"><strong>Octopress</strong></a>] blogging framework which was used to to generate these website pages along with the use of the site hosting service which is being provided by <strong>[<a href="http://www.github.com">GitHub</a>]</strong>.</p>

<p>For some time now I have always just wanted to have a website just for the sake of <strong>being part of</strong> what <strong>the internet</strong> is -which is a collection of human shared ideas- as we collectively assimilate our disparate thoughts into harnessing the also ever growing <em>collective power of the internet</em>. Now it is more of a means of necessity that I think I should have a website. For me, it is going to be a personal documentation area, where I can just jot down any procedures or things that I come across ever-so-often and that they may be little reminders of things which I think are noteworthy. Also <strong>for you</strong>, hopefully it will be a <em>resource of little reminders</em> . In addition to that, its just a fun creative outlet for me to do something somewhat technical and enjoy the use of technology as it is in today&#8217;s format. Yes, that&#8217;s it. Its a celebration of the internet by using that very said collective resource and adding to it.</p>
